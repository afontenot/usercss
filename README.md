# usercss
collection of usercss files for various sites

The various third party sites for sharing these tend to be sketchy or
poorly maintained. I'm putting mine up here to share with others.

Anyone is welcome to use them or contribute changes.

To install these files, use the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)
extension. **Don't** use the Stylish extension; the extension was
bought by a for-profit company, and [included spyware in the past,
and probably still does](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/).
