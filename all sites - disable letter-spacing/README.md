# all sites - disable letter-spacing

Some sites think it's """stylish""" to do something stupid like

    letter-spacing: 1.1

on their body text. It has the effect of making it abolutely
unreadable. Fastmail.com is a worst-offender here, showing
text in the email client with incorrect letter spacing.

This script simply resets letter spacing globally. I've never run
into a site where this causes problems, but it fixes spacing on a 
ton of sites where it's broken.
