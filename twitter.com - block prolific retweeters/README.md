# twitter.com - block prolific retweeters

Sometimes you want to follow someone on Twitter, because their
posts are good, but they retweet entirely too much. It would be
nice to only see their posts, and not stuff they retweet, but Twitter
doesn't provide that level of granularity.

This usercss makes up for that. Use it to hide retweets from specific
accounts. The css file is prepopulated with the account I follow that
I want to hide retweets from.
