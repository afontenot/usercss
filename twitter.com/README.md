#twitter.com - hide hashflags

"Hashflags" are the annoying icons or emoji that appear next to
certain hashtags, usually for a certain period of time. Most of 
these are advertizing, and all of them are annoying.

#twitter.com - hide sidebar

New Twitter is pretty poorly designed and wastes space on things
no one wants to see. At least if you hide the sidebar it looks
a bit better.
