# twitch.tv - mirror video for reverse-grav MM2 levels

The game Mario Maker 2 has a mode in which gravity is reversed.
These levels are *extremely* entertaining to watch with the 
video mirrored vertically, since this causes them to look
almost exactly like normal levels, and the streamer incompetent.

Fun!


# twitch.tv - zoom rifftrax videos

Sometimes I watch streams at twitch.tv/rifftrax. Many of the films
they show are older films that aren't in widescreen aspect ratios.
However, their stream doesn't adapt and letter boxes the video in
a 16:9 feed. This leads to a double letter-boxing where the video
is inset and hard to watch.

To use this, you'll likely need to tune the zoom value to the correct
amount for your screen and maybe even on a per-video basis.
