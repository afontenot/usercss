#twitch.tv - mirror video for reverse-grav MM2 levels

The game Mario Maker 2 has a mode in which gravity is reversed.
These levels are *extremely* entertaining to watch with the 
video mirrored vertically, since this causes them to look
almost exactly like normal levels, and the streamer incompetent.

Fun!
